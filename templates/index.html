      My first encounter with programming was in the 6th grade where I learned that computers do exactly what 
      you tell them to. My 6th grade teacher, Mr.Contreas, held an afterschool robotics club that I joined.
      During club time he would create obstacle courses for us, outlining the path 
      that we were supposed to follow with duct tape. I remember writing the code and 
      running it on the robot and each time it took the course it would take a slightly different
      route, even though I hadn't changed the code. This would encourage me make tweaks in the code each run
      with no success. It was a vicious cycle until I realized that where we put the robot as the starting position was of
      utmost importance! Once the starting position was consistent, things improved.
  <p>
  <p>
      Again in middle school, I helped put together a part of a robot. In high school I joined FIRST Robotics 
      and was fortunate enough to attend competitions in Davis, CA and San Jose, CA in 2022, with my team taking 
      our robot to the world champs in Texas. I was a part of building and coding the robot and at competitions acted as a strategist. 
  </p>
  </p>After graduating, I was exploring career options and after careful consideration I chose to pursue software engineering.
    I spent months building a foundation in coding by creating a website and mastering the basics. Then I applied to Hackbright Academy 
    and was accepted to be a part of the Full Time Full Stack Software Engineering cohort. I built a Flask based web app and have been
    furthering my learning since. </p>
